In a world aglow with winter's charm,
Where snowflakes dance and spirits warm,
You've found the first of many a clue,
A breadcrumb left just for you.

Beneath the twinkling Christmas light,
Through silent nights and frosty white,
Your journey's just begun, it's true,
With festive cheer to guide you through.

So celebrate this merry find,
A treasure hunt of the rarest kind,
For each step leads to joys anew,
On this yuletide path laid out for you.

Merry Christmas and well done!
The adventure's started, the fun's begun.
May each breadcrumb lead to delight,
On this magical, starlit Christmas night.
